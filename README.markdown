TodoFRP
=======

Functional reactive programming: like model view controller, except better because it's functional and stuff.

In the same spirit of [TodoMVC](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/), TodoFRP showcases different functional implementations of the exact same application so that you can decide for yourself what makes sense and what doesn't.
