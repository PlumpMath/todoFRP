TodoFRP
=======

Functional reactive programming: like model view controller, except better because it's functional and stuff.

In the same spirit of [TodoMVC](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/), TodoFRP showcases different functional implementations of the exact same application so that you can decide for yourself what makes sense and what doesn't.

Apps
====

Todo
----
A todo list.

 + ClojureScript + C2
 + ClojureScript + Angular.js
 
Others?
-------
I'm open to adding more small-but-interesting applications/components/problems so we can compare beyond todo lists.
Open an issue with a problem description and spec.
